            <p>
                CSS Selectors let you <em>select </em> individual HTML Elements in an HTML Document. This is <strong>super</strong> useful. <br>
                Classes are ridiculously important, since they allow you to select arbitraty boxes in your webpages. <br>
                Once you successfully develop a set of selectors and CSS rules, its relativelys easy to match a documentto those <br>
                rules
